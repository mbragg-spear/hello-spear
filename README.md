# Hello, Spear!


###### `whoami`
My name is Matthew Bragg, and I've been working in the computer/cyber field for 6 years.

###### `cat ./skillbridge-goal`
I've joined the SkillBridge program with Spear AI in order to gain vital skills, and because the mission of Spear sounds both exciting and important to real world mission activities.

###### `grep -rPh '(?=.*[Ee]xcited)(?=.*[Ll]earn)' ./`
I am most excited to learn more about and practice software development within a team setting.

##### `ls -lah ./objectives/*`
Specific learning objectives I'd like to tackle:
- Becoming fluent in Typescript.
- Creating and deploying IAS solutions across diverse systems.
- Mastering Docker, Podman, Orbstack, and other container software.
